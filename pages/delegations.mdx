# Delegations

Call actions like build, mine, hit, move, etc on the behalf of another player. The player will use the client to register (and conditionally unregister) delegation to this contract.

Copy `packages/hardhat/examples/Delegate.sol` to get started.

Define the logic for `canUnregister` - the only required function of the inherited `ICustomUnregisterDelegation` contract.

```solidity
contract Game is ICustomUnregisterDelegation {

  /**
   * @notice Executes logic before unregistering the user's delegation to this contract.
   * @param delegator The address which has delegated control to this contract.
  */
  function canUnregister(address delegator) external returns (bool);

}

```

Use `callFrom()` to call an action on behalf of the delegator. For example:

```solidity
 bytes memory dropCallData = abi.encodeCall(IDropSystem.drop, (inventoryEntityIds, dropCoord));

 IWorld(biomeWorldAddress).callFrom(delegatorAddress, DropSystemId, dropCallData);
```
