# Get Started

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/tenetxyz/biomes-scaffold.git
cd biomes-scaffold
yarn install
```

2. Create an `.env` under `packages/hardhat` and set your deployer private key to `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`. Deploy the extension contract.

```
yarn deploy --network garnet
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the Redstone garnet testnet. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

3. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. By default, it will connect to the Redstone garnet Testnet. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

- Edit your smart contract `Game.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend in `packages/nextjs/pages`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
